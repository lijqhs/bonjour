## Direct object pronouns


- Direct object pronouns are placed before the conjugated verb in French sentences.
- When used with compound tenses, such as the passé composé, the pronoun is placed before the auxiliary verb (e.g., "Il m'a vu" - He saw me).
- Pronouns agree in gender and number with the nouns they replace.

| French Pronoun | English Equivalent | Example Sentence in French          |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| me (m')        | me                 | Il me voit. (He sees me.)          |
| te (t')        | you                | Je te comprends. (I understand you.) |
| le (l')        | him, it            | Je le vois. (I see him/it.)        |
| la (l')        | her, it            | Je la connais. (I know her/it.)    |
| nous           | us                 | Il nous entend. (He hears us.)     |
| vous           | you                | Je vous appelle. (I call you.)      |
| les            | them               | Je les vois. (I see them.)         |


## what / which: *quel*

In French, the words "what" and "which" are translated as "quel," "quelle," "quels," and "quelles," depending on the gender and number of the noun they modify. These are known as interrogative adjectives and are used to ask questions about specific items or people.

- "Quel" and its variations must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify.
- They are used to ask questions about specific items or people.
- These words are often followed by a noun or the verb "être" (to be) when asking about a specific choice or identification.

|--------------|--------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| quel         | what/which         | Masculine Singular  | Quel livre lis-tu ? (Which book are you reading?) |
| quelle       | what/which         | Feminine Singular   | Quelle robe préfères-tu ? (Which dress do you prefer?) |

## Demonstrative pronouns: *celui*
