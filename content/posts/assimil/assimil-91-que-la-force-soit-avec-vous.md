## interrogative

### Raised-intonation

This is the simplest and most informal way to form questions in French:

- Structure: Use the same word order as a statement, but raise the intonation at the end.
- Example: "Tu aimes le chocolat?" (You like chocolate?)
- Usage: Common in casual conversations and everyday speech.
- Advantage: Easy to construct and sounds natural in informal settings.

### *Est-ce que*

This is a versatile and widely used method for forming questions in both spoken and written French:

- Structure: Add "est-ce que" (literally "is it that") at the beginning of a statement.
- Example: "Est-ce que tu aimes le chocolat?" (Do you like chocolate?)
- Usage: Suitable for both formal and informal contexts, often used in writing.
- Advantage: Doesn't require changing word order and works with all types of questions.

### Inverted

This is the most formal way to ask questions in French and is commonly used in writing and formal speech:

- Structure: Invert the subject pronoun and verb, connecting them with a hyphen.
- Example: "Aimes-tu le chocolat?" (Do you like chocolate?)
- Usage: Formal writing, literature, and polite speech.
- Advantage: Considered more elegant and is essential in formal French.

## causative

The **French causative** structure with **"faire"** is used when one person causes another to do something. It can express different shades of meaning depending on context, including **making, letting, or having someone do something**.


### 1. Basic Structure
The core structure is:

**Faire + infinitive + (agent/doer of the action, if needed)**

📔 **Examples:**
- **Je fais laver ma voiture.**  
  → *I am having my car washed.*  
  _(Someone else does the washing, not me.)_

- **Elle fait réparer son téléphone.**  
  → *She has her phone repaired.*  
  _(Someone else repairs it.)_

- **Le professeur fait lire un livre aux élèves.**  
  → *The teacher makes the students read a book.*  
  _(The students do the reading.)_


### 2. Expressing Who Performs the Action
When you mention **who actually does the action**, you usually introduce them with **"par"** (for things done by professionals) or **"à"** (when someone is made to do something). However, in spoken French, this is often left out.

📔 **Examples:**
- **Je fais nettoyer la maison par une femme de ménage.**  
  → *I have the house cleaned by a housekeeper.*  

- **Il fait écrire la lettre à son assistant.**  
  → *He has his assistant write the letter.*  

- **Elle a fait réparer son ordinateur par un technicien.**  
  → *She had her computer repaired by a technician.*  


### 3. Reflexive Verbs in the Causative
When the action affects the subject themselves, **"se faire"** is used.

📔 **Examples:**
- **Je me fais couper les cheveux.**  
  → *I am getting my hair cut.*  

- **Elle s'est fait tatouer.**  
  → *She got a tattoo.*  

💡 **Important:** In the **passé composé**, the past participle of **"faire"** never agrees in gender/number with the subject when used in the causative structure.  
- **Elle s’est fait couper les cheveux.** (✅ Correct)  
- **Elle s’est faite couper les cheveux.** (❌ Incorrect)


### 4. Causative in Different Tenses
The verb **"faire"** can be conjugated in different tenses, while the second verb remains in the **infinitive**.

| **Tense** | **Example** | **Translation** |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Présent** | Je fais cuisiner mon frère. | I make my brother cook. |
| **Passé composé** | J’ai fait réparer ma voiture. | I had my car repaired. |
| **Imparfait** | Il faisait travailler ses employés. | He was making his employees work. |
| **Futur** | Nous ferons construire une maison. | We will have a house built. |


### 5. Causative vs. Passive
Sometimes, **"faire + infinitive"** can resemble the **passive voice** because the subject isn’t doing the action directly.

- **Il a fait arrêter le voleur.**  
  → *He had the thief arrested.* _(He didn’t arrest the thief himself.)_

Compare with the passive:  
- **Le voleur a été arrêté par la police.**  
  → *The thief was arrested by the police.*  

The causative emphasizes that someone **caused** the action, while the passive just states that it happened.


### 6. Difference Between "Faire" and "Laisser"
- **Faire + infinitive** → Someone causes an action to happen.  
- **Laisser + infinitive** → Someone allows an action to happen.

| **French** | **English** |
|------------|------------|
| Il fait travailler son fils. | He makes his son work. |
| Il laisse travailler son fils. | He lets his son work. |


### Summary
- **"Faire + infinitive"** means *to make/have someone do something.*
- The actual **doer of the action** can be introduced with **"par"** (professional) or **"à"** (person made to do something).
- Reflexive verbs use **"se faire"** (e.g., *se faire couper les cheveux*).
- **Tense applies to "faire"**, not the second verb.
- **Causative differs from passive** in that it shows **who caused the action**.

## subjunctive

| **French Expression (Requires Subjunctive)** | **Example Sentence** |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Qui que** | *Qui que tu sois, tu seras le bienvenu.* (*Whoever you are, you will be welcome.*) |
| **Quoi que** | *Quoi que tu fasses, fais-le bien.* (*Whatever you do, do it well.*) |
| **Où que** | *Où que tu ailles, je te suivrai.* (*Wherever you go, I will follow you.*) |
| **Quand que** / **À quelque moment que** | *À quelque moment que tu viennes, préviens-moi.* (*Whenever you come, let me know.*) |
| **De quelque manière que** | *De quelque manière que tu répondes, sois poli.* (*However you answer, be polite.*) |

---

## *Dont*

### Main Uses of "Dont"

1. 👉 Replacing "de" + noun
"Dont" replaces both the preposition "de" and the noun it refers to[1][2]. For example:
- Le livre dont je parle (The book I'm talking about)
- La fille dont j'ai oublié le nom (The girl whose name I've forgotten)

2. 🏠 Expressing possession
"Dont" can be used to indicate possession, similar to "whose" in English[1][4]:
- L'homme dont le chapeau est rouge (The man whose hat is red)
- Je cherche la maison dont la porte est jaune (I'm looking for the house with a yellow door)

3. 🗣️ With verbs requiring "de"
Use "dont" after verbs that typically use the preposition "de"[1][2]:
- Le film dont nous avons parlé (The movie we talked about)
- La soirée dont tout le monde parle (The party everyone is talking about)

4. 👥 Referring to members of a group
"Dont" can mean "of which" or "including"[4][7]:
- J'ai beaucoup d'amis, dont deux poètes (I have many friends, two of whom are poets)

### Important Rules

1. 🔄 "Dont" is invariable
It doesn't change form to agree with gender or number[2].

2. ❌ Avoid double prepositions
Never use "de" and "dont" together in the same sentence[2].

3. 🚫 Not for subjects
"Dont" cannot replace the subject of a sentence[1].

## **The Pluperfect Tense (Le Plus-que-parfait)**  

The **pluperfect tense (plus-que-parfait)** is used to describe an action that **took place before another past action**. It is the equivalent of **"had + past participle"** in English (e.g., *I had finished*).  


### 1. Formation of the Pluperfect
The **plus-que-parfait** is formed with:  
✅ **Imperfect tense of "avoir" or "être" + past participle of the main verb**  

#### Avoir as the Auxiliary (Most Verbs)
| Subject | **Avoir** (Imperfect) | Past Participle | Example |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Je | avais | fini | *J'avais fini.* (*I had finished.*) |
| Tu | avais | mangé | *Tu avais mangé.* (*You had eaten.*) |
| Il/Elle/On | avait | parlé | *Elle avait parlé.* (*She had spoken.*) |
| Nous | avions | acheté | *Nous avions acheté une maison.* (*We had bought a house.*) |
| Vous | aviez | vu | *Vous aviez vu ce film.* (*You had seen this movie.*) |
| Ils/Elles | avaient | pris | *Ils avaient pris le train.* (*They had taken the train.*) |

#### Être as the Auxiliary (For Reflexive and Certain Verbs)
Some verbs use **être** instead of **avoir**, mainly:  
- **Dr. & Mrs. Vandertramp verbs** (verbs of motion like *aller, venir, partir*)  
- **Reflexive verbs** (*se lever, se réveiller*)  

| Subject | **Être** (Imperfect) | Past Participle | Example |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Je | étais | allé(e) | *J’étais allé(e) au marché.* (*I had gone to the market.*) |
| Tu | étais | parti(e) | *Tu étais parti tôt.* (*You had left early.*) |
| Il/Elle/On | était | arrivé(e) | *Elle était arrivée à l’heure.* (*She had arrived on time.*) |
| Nous | étions | venus | *Nous étions venus en voiture.* (*We had come by car.*) |
| Vous | étiez | entré(e)(s) | *Vous étiez entrés dans la salle.* (*You had entered the room.*) |
| Ils/Elles | étaient | resté(e)s | *Elles étaient restées à la maison.* (*They had stayed at home.*) |


### 2. Agreement Rules
✅ Verbs that use **être** must agree in gender and number with the subject.  
✅ Reflexive verbs **always take être** and follow the same agreement rules.  

🔹 **Example (With Agreement)**  
- *Elle était allée au musée.* (*She had gone to the museum.*)  
- *Nous étions partis tôt.* (*We had left early.*)  


### 3. When to Use the Pluperfect

✅ **To Describe an Action Completed Before Another Past Action**  
- *J’avais déjà mangé quand tu es arrivé.* (*I had already eaten when you arrived.*)  

✅ **To Explain a Cause or Background in the Past**  
- *Il pleurait parce qu’il avait perdu son portefeuille.* (*He was crying because he had lost his wallet.*)  

✅ **To Express Regret or a Missed Opportunity**  
- *Si j’avais su, je serais venu plus tôt.* (*If I had known, I would have come earlier.*)  


### 4. Comparison with Other Past Tenses

| **Tense** | **Example** | **English Equivalent** | **Use** |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|------|
| **Passé composé** | *J’ai fini mon travail.* | *I finished my work.* | Completed action in the past |
| **Imparfait** | *Je faisais mes devoirs.* | *I was doing my homework.* | Ongoing/habitual past action |
| **Plus-que-parfait** | *J’avais déjà mangé.* | *I had already eaten.* | Action completed before another past event |


### Summary
| **Rule** | **Example** |
|----------|------------|
| **Use "avoir" or "être" in the imperfect + past participle** | *J'avais terminé mes études avant de commencer à travailler.* (*I had finished my studies before starting work.*) |
| **Use for actions that happened before another past event** | *Quand nous sommes arrivés, il était déjà parti.* (*When we arrived, he had already left.*) |
| **Verbs with "être" must agree in gender/number** | *Elles étaient parties tôt.* (*They had left early.*) |
