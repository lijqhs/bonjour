## L'imparfait

The French **imperfect tense** (imparfait) is a descriptive past tense that indicates an ongoing state of being or a repeated or incomplete action. The beginning and end of the state of being or action are not indicated, and the imperfect is very often translated in English as "was" or "was ___-ing".

We use the **imperfect tense** to describe situations, people, properties, comments, explanations, repeated actions, and simultaneously occurring actions in the past. 

The imperfect tense is used for *continuous* or *habitual* actions in the past, notably those that, in English, are in the past continous. 
- **Elle vivait à Lyon à l'époque.** She was living in Lyon at the time.

It is used particularly in sentences where a continuing action is interrupted by a single action in the past:
- **Elle dormait quand son téléphone a sonné.** She was sleeping when her phone rang.

### Conjugation

To conjugate the imperfect tense in French, we take the present-tense stem of the 1st person plural form of the verb (the nous form), and add the endings *-ais*, *-ais*, *-ait*, *-ions*, *-iez* and *-aient* to the root of the present tense nous form of the verb.

Here's an example of how to use the imperfect tense in a sentence:

> Quand il était petit, Lucas aimait beaucoup les gâteaux. Tous les jours, il faisait un gâteau avec son amie Florence. Pendant qu'il regardait la recette, Florence préparait la pâte. Ils cuisaient le gâteau puis mangeaient une part au dessert. [^1]

### Special cases

The impersonal verb **falloir** and the defective verb **pleuvoir**, are both used in the third person singular only:
- *il fallait*
- *il pleuvait*

In the case of *-er* verbs like **lancer**, to throw, the *c* takes a cedilla before the letter *a* (if not, the *c* would be a hard *k*): 
- *il lançait*

Likewise, in verbs such as **manger**, *to eat*, and **déranger**, *to disturb*, the *g* becomes *ge* before *a* and *o* (otherwise, the *g* would be hard *g*):
- *tu mangeais*
- *il dérangeait*


### Compare: imparfait, passé composé, passé simple

The **imperfect tense** is used to describe ongoing states of being or repeated or incomplete actions in the past. It is often translated in English as “was” or “was ___-ing”. We use the imperfect tense to describe situations, people, properties, comments, explanations, repeated actions, and simultaneously occurring actions in the past. [^2]
- *En été, j'allais faire de la randonnée toutes les semaines.* In summer, I went hiking every week.

The **passé composé** is used to describe *completed*, sequential, or one-time actions that took place on a specific occasion in the past. It is often translated in English as “did” or “has done”.
- *En été, je suis allé faire de la randonnée quatre fois.* In summer, I went hiking four times.

In both cases of above examples, there is a repetitive action, but the first sentence describes a habitual (and less precise) action.

The **passé simple** is used to describe completed, sequential, or one-time actions that took place on a specific occasion in the past, effectively the same as passé composé, but used for actions in the very distant past, more commonly used in literature than in spoken French. [^3] [^4]
