## 🧠 Base meaning of **genre**:

Originally, **genre** means:

- **noun**: *type*, *kind*, *category*  
  > *Quel genre de musique tu aimes ?*  
  > *What kind of music do you like?*

But in **spoken French**, especially among younger people or in informal settings, it has evolved a lot 👇

## 🔥 Casual Uses of **genre** in Spoken French

### 1. **Filler word / Discourse marker** — like *"like"* in English

> **C’était, genre, trop bizarre.**  
> ➡️ *It was, like, super weird.*

Here, **"genre"** is just a filler — to buy time or make something sound softer or less direct.

---

### 2. **To give an example / approximation**

> **Il est, genre, médecin ou un truc comme ça.**  
> ➡️ *He's, like, a doctor or something.*

> **Il m’a dit de venir à, genre, 18h.**  
> ➡️ *He told me to come at like 6 PM.*

---

### 3. **To express disbelief or emphasis (sarcastic or exaggerated)**

> **Genre il va vraiment faire ça ?**  
> ➡️ *As if he’s actually gonna do that?*  
> ➡️ *You really think he’s gonna do that?*

Here, it adds an ironic or skeptical tone — a bit like *"as if..."* in English.

### 4. **To rephrase or clarify what you mean**

> **Je suis fatigué… genre, j’en peux plus.**  
> ➡️ *I’m tired… like, I seriously can’t take it anymore.*

> **C’est genre hyper important.**  
> ➡️ *It’s like super important.*

## ⚠️ Things to note:
- It’s **super common in spoken French**, especially among younger speakers.
- In formal writing or speech? Use with caution — it's too casual there.
- It's *not* just a direct translation of “like” in every case, but they overlap a lot in tone and use.
